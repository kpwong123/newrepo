            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <p>There are three types of weapons in fencing, namely Foil, Sabre and Epee. Each of the weapons has its own
                appearance, rules and tactics. While one can choose to play all three weapons, professional athletes
                usually
                prefer mastering their skills in one weapon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="weapontypes">
            <h2>Foil</h2>
            <p>Foil is a weapon with a light body and a small guard. It is a thrusting weapon which is used to target
                opponent's torso. Hitting the head, hands and legs are considered misses such that the player does not
                score
                points with these invalid targets. The rule of <i>'Right of Way'</i>, which is exclusive to Foil and
                Sabre,
                allows referee to determine which player has the priority to score points. Typically, the player who
                attacks
                first and remains aggressive throughout the phase gets the priority to score points. However, if the
                opponent parries the blade during the attack and hits a valid target, he then gains the priority to
                score a
                point.</p>

            <h2>Epee</h2>
            <p>Epee is a thrusting weapon with a relatively heavier body and a larger guard covering the hand. Two
                grips,
                namely the pistol grip and the French grip, are commonly used among Epee fencers. Unlike Foil, valid
                targets
                in Epee cover the whole body including the head, legs and hands. Epee has no rules of 'Right of way',
                therefore
                resulting in a much slower pace during the game.</p>

            <h2>Sabre</h2>
            <p>Sabre is the only thrusting and cutting weapon in fencing in which players are required to slash or hit
                the
                upper body of the opponent in order to be awarded. Sabre has a light blade with a guard similar to a
                cavalry
                sword which extends to the tip of the handle. Because of its relative ease for players to hit a valid
                target, it has the most fast-paced and aggressive games in fencing. Players constantly move along the
                piste
                in order to avoid being hit and also to draw mistakes from their opponents. </p>
