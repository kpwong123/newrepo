Happy Wheels is not dying,"
                        Hello friends. I probably should have made a news post about this a while ago, but surprises are nice I guess. There has been a javascript version of Happy Wheels in the works since early 2019. It will be out before Flash is murdered by Chrome. Was scheduled for this month actually, but I don't see that happening so immediately. I probably didn't want to tell anyone so nobody would ask me when it will be released.

A nice upgrade is that it will run at 60 fps (interpolated, physics will still be 30 fps). Unfortunately all older replays will be inaccurate though as Box2d will have been updated slightly. They'll still be there for the sake of top records. If you somehow play the Flash version, they'll function fine.

I'm not developing the port, but I hired a company who I thought was most capable. I'll give more details once it's up. I'm still solely working on the sequel (and it is going well)."
Some Stuff,"
                        Hello pals. I'd like to continue hosting the flash version of Happy Wheels as long as possible. With the loss of certain ad networks, I'm going to try out a few different ad formats on this site as I continue to attempt to regain some of the revenue that went missing. I'll be making a few minor changes here and there to see whatever works best. Nothing should be annoying. This heads up was the main reason for this news post.

The discord server, which is now official at https://discord.gg/happywheels, has been very helpful to me and the game. Through it I was introduced to some cool users, several of which have become much needed moderators who have greatly improved the quality of the general level submissions. There are also some really great tools that server admin Kittenswolf has made that have automated sharing and reporting of levels. I've not seen a naked watermelon level in months. I also managed to speak with a lot of featured level authors... some that I had never even communicated with, despite their massive contributions to the game (IAMURHUSBAND, bobisdacool1, Iamverybored, Farlaineloco... there are others, those were most recent). Anyways, if you're reading this, you'd probably like to visit that place. There's also a chance I may be on as I've been using discord to speak to my brother as we murder rats in Vermintide 2.

Though I would prefer to be silent, I feel obligated to say that I am still working full time on the sequel, and it's still reeeeeaally time consuming. Thankfully, much of the basic graphics engine is complete, and I've been building out the new editor with it over the past year. There are so many complexities to building out all of the vector drawing tools that function similarly to Flash, that I have developed a much greater level of an appreciation for that program. I'm actually going to have to build in pen support as that would totally be possible given the way the brush tool works. That would allow me to actually make much of my own artwork for the game in the editor itself. I don't like sharing media of what I'm working on as I would just prefer the final product to speak for itself. That's all I've got for now."
video ad problems?,"
                        Hello everyone. I realize I have not made a news post in around 2 years. I think the topic here borders on a slight emergency, so I'm making this one.

Earlier this year google decided, after 7 years, that they no longer felt Happy Wheels was appropriate for their ads. It was fine all that time, but now, after zero changes to my content, it's offensive. In a very slow manner, I've made the effort to replace that revenue by using other ad networks. Flash ads no longer seem to be viable, so, as you may have noticed, I just recently added an html5 ad before Happy Wheels loads.

From my own testing I've not been able to find any bugs, however many of you have reached out to tell me they cannot play the game. If you're having issues loading Happy Wheels, please tell me what you're experiencing in the comments below. Tell me the browser you're using, the operating system, what you see, and any other pertinent information. When I first uploaded the changes, there was indeed a bug that affected 1 of my 2 front end servers which prevented the game from loading. However I fixed that on Friday morning (yesterday). I've still gotten a couple complaints though. If there's an issue, I can't fix it unless I know what it is.

Outside of that, I realize I owe everyone a very long blog post regarding the current state of what the hell I've been doing. The short version is that I'm still just working on the sequel to Happy Wheels, and I'm extremely poor at time estimates. I've been building my own game engine from scratch. Unlike the flash version of Happy Wheels, I've basically had to learn a new language and construct all of my own tools before I could even get to the creative side of things. Logically all the steps I've had to take make sense to me, but actually implementing them is absurdly time consuming. Though daunting, I do find solving each successive problem to be rewarding and educational... I just wish I could magically present everyone with what I'm working towards now rather than at some undetermined point in the future. So, I'm sorry to everyone that I can only now offer more waiting. If anyone cares, I'm doing well, I've made enough money to fund development for however long it takes, I will put in as much detail as I feel necessary, I'm currently working on the editor, I've made significant progress, and I think I will make an excellent game worthy of everyone's time. Hopefully it will become the fully featured platform I always wanted Happy Wheels to be. Blah blah blah.

*The issue should be fixed as far as I can tell. If it's not please complain in this Happy Wheels discord here: https://discord.gg/6UKrjNa
